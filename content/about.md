Lyon NLP Connect is created with the purpose of netwroking.

We are PhD students at the ERIC Laboratory (Université de Lyon, Lyon 2), organizing collaborative sessions (research seminars, Birds-of-a-Feather discussions) on Natural Language Processing and related topics in Lyon. These sessions aim to bring together PhD students from universities of Lyon and Saint-Étienne, and the broader Lyon NLP community to foster brainstorming, collaboration, and networking. 

If you’d like to participate, please fill out the form below.
